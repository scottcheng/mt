analysis:
-	Where google did better?
关键		the key				key
It's language convention to use 'the key' instead of 'key'. Our MT system does not have a strategy to deal with countable noun or add 'the' to nouns.

避免		avoid				help 
回答 		answer				response
印象		impression			show 		
Clearly, 'avoid' is more suitable for this context. Our MT system pick 'help' from all the translation of '避免' because 'help' has the highest unigram score. It does not make sense since we did not count in the probability of Chinese-to-English tranlation. Although P(help) > P(avoid), P(help|避免) < P(avoid|避免).
Same reasoning for (回答,answer,response) and (印象,impression,show).

-	Where we did better?
因为		because				for
It would make more sense to use 'because of' rather than 'because', which is connection between sentences rather than phrases, where 'for' makes more sense here.

-	Where both google and our MT did reasonble?
The translation google and our MT agreed with makes sense.
Since the context is not quite specific, the following ones are both acceptable tranlations.
问题		question			case
好/好的	good 				fine
难		difficult			hard

-	Where neither google and our MT did reasonble?
很		-					only
留下		-					stay

'很' -> really is a good translation. google did not translate at all which somehow loss the meaning of the word. 'only' does not make sense here.
Same reasoning for '留下'.

analysis:

政治 	politics					action
美式		American 					American-style
影视作品	movies and television work  produce

Clearly, 'politics' is more suitable for this context. Our MT system pick 'action' from all the translation of '政治' because 'action' has the highest unigram score. It does not make sense since we did not count in the probability of Chinese-to-English tranlation. Although P(action) > P(politics), P(action|政治) < P(politics|政治).
Same reasoning for (美式,American,American-style)

影视作品	movies and television work  produce
Google's translation 'movies and television work' must be a work of statitical model result since this is quite hard to get from a single word translation of '影视作品'. Our MT system does not support such good strategie.

-	Where we did better?
残酷			brutal					cruelty		(政治的残酷	brutal politics			action 's cruelty)
Here '残酷' is supposed to be a noun and the whole translation of the phrase would be like 'the cruelty of politics'. As mentioned, our MT did bad on the '政治' part but ours gives the correct noun characteritics of '残酷' and this is the result of our good word segmentation and word characteritics assignment.

-	Where both google and our MT did reasonble?
The translation google and our MT agreed with makes sense.
Since the context is not quite specific, the following ones are both acceptable tranlations.
阴暗		dark						obscurity
抽象概念	abstractions				abstract

		Google 						MT
把		put							handle
Google is doing a little bit better but '把' has way better translation than these two.

变得		become						run
These translations are just not working.

题材		-							subject
google did not translate at all which somehow loss the info of this word. 'subject' does not make sense here.

美国		American					republicanism
Google messed up the characteristcs of the word where our MT translation did. However,'republicanism' is not a proper tranlation here.

differences:

听了		heard 				heared
话		words				word
气的浑身	the gas did			catch great all over the body
乱战		shake 				quiver

analysis:
-	Where google did better?
话		words				word
'话' typically stands for sentences or words. In some scenarios, single word also makes sense. In general, 'words' is a better translation. Our MT system pick 'word' from all the translation of '话' because 'word' has the highest unigram score, which is not a clever choice in this case.

-	Where we did better?
听了		heard 				heared
Our MT catch the past tense of the sentence from the word '了', which is one of our strategy. Thus, we did better.

-	Where both google and our MT did reasonble?
The translation google and our MT agreed with makes sense.
乱战		shake 				quiver
Maybe 'shake' is a little better 'quiver', but they are both good translations.

-	Where neither google and our MT did reasonble?
气的浑身	the gas did			catch great all over the body
This is just a really difficult phrases combination for translation. I guess only using huge corpus with statistical model would result in good translation.

Skating rink shut the door, almost no government funding, many coaches have left Russia.

几乎		almost				about

许多教练	many coaches		much coach
离开了	have left			already parted
	
analysis:
-	Where google did better?
		Google 				our MT
许多教练	many coaches		much coach
Google catches 'coach' is countable noun and use 'many' to describe it, while we do not support such strategy so we both did bad on 'much' and miss the plural translation of 'coach'.

离开 	left				parted
Clearly, 'left' is more suitable for this context. Our MT system pick 'parted' from all the translation of '离开' because 'parted' has the highest unigram score. It does not make sense since we did not count in the probability of Chinese-to-English tranlation. Although P(parted) > P(left), P(parted|离开) < P(left|离开).
Same reasoning for (几乎,almost,about) and (没有,no,lack).


-	Where we did better?
关了门	shut the door		was closed
Google uses 'shut the door' which is a more physical translation while our 'was closed' definitely is more reasonable since the original sentence is stating the place is shut down rather than the door is shut down. This is the result of our unigram strategy.

-	Where both google and our MT did reasonble?
The translation google and our MT agreed with makes sense.

政府		government			state
资金投入	funding				capital investment
Since the context is not quite specific, the above ones are both acceptable tranlations.

任何		- 					any
It won't hurt if did not translate '任何' as google did and it also makes sense to translate '任何' into 'any'.

-	Where neither google and our MT did reasonble?
None

analysis:
-	Where google did better?
重视 		emphasis		prize
泡沫 		bubble			head
Clearly, 'emphasis' is more suitable for this context. Our MT system pick 'prize' from all the translation of '重视' because 'prize' has the highest unigram score. It does not make sense since we did not count in the probability of Chinese-to-English tranlation. Although P(prize) > P(emphasis), P(prize|重视) < P(emphasis|重视).
Same reasoning for (泡沫,bubble,head)

而不是 		rather than		whilst but 	
We did poor on this because our sentence segmentation segments this phrase into '而' and '不是' so that it could not catch the right sense of the whole phrase.

推波助澜		fueled			fuel
Google gets the sense of 'be fueled' rather than actively 'fuel'. This is a minor thing but our MT just did not have such strategy.

-	Where we did better?
None

-	Where both google and our MT did reasonble?
The translation google and our MT agreed with makes sense.
Since the context is not quite specific, the following ones are both acceptable tranlations.
有人			some 			somebody
担心			worry 			concern
互联网		Internet		web

-	Where neither google and our MT did reasonble?
这种 		is 				of this kind
做法			practice 		course
A good translation would be 'such action/behavior'. It's just that none of Google or our MT did well. Our system would do better if '这种做法' was not segmented into two separate phrases.

在给			to 				in for
our sentence segmentation segments this phrase into '在' and '给' so that it could not catch the right sense of the whole phrase while google did do well either.
