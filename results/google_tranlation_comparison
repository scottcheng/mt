*** Comparison: google translation is better.
	Among all the different phrase translation below, google did a better job that the phrases fit the context better than our MT.
				Google 			MT
	'这种'		is 				of this kind
	'重视'		emphasis		prize
	'而不是'		rather			whilst but 		
	'泡沫'		bubble			head

-	'这种'
google: '这种' -> 'is'. This is reasonable for Chinese-English tranlation since '这种' states the belonging relationship to the subject before this phrase. However, using "'s" would be better.
MT:  '这种' -> 'of this kind'. This is more like a word-to-word translation which is good in phrase translation but no quite suitable for sentence translation.

-	'重视'
google: '重视' -> 'emphasis'. This is most frequent and context-reasonable word tranlation for '重视'. 
MT:  '重视' -> 'prize'. Our random chosed translation just does not make sense in this context.

-	'而不是'
google: '而不是' -> 'rather'. This is most frequent and context-reasonable word tranlation for '而不是'. 
MT:  '而不是' -> 'whilst but'. Our MT system segments '而不是' into '而' and '不是' so that it not only gives much word-to-word translation but also did not pick a good word-to-word translation for these two phrases.

-	'泡沫'
google: '泡沫' -> 'bubble'. This is most frequent and context-reasonable word tranlation for '泡沫'. 
MT:  '泡沫' -> 'head'. Our random chosed translation just does not make sense in this context.
